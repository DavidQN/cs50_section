# CS50 Section

## Introduction

This repository will contain code samples I created for my weekly sectionâ€™s. If you are a student in one of my sections, I recommend to check this repository periodically as I will upload slides and code after each section. Since section is limited to 75 minutes, On occasion I can only cover the concepts and not have enough time to present all the example code, but to combat this on most of the example code you will notice an extensive amount of comments to help walk you through what is going on. Hopefully my comments and code can help give you a better understanding of the implementation of the theory provided in section and lecture.

If you are in my section and have any questions or suggestions, please email me at dan388@g.harvard.edu
