// We donâ€™t have to specify data types in JavaScript, but we do need to indicate
// when we are creating a variable, with the keyword `let` which indicates the word
// after this keyword will be this variables namelet x = 3;
let x = 3;
let y = "3";

// You can also omit semicolons, because JavaScript is smart enough to know when a statement
// ends at runtime, but by convention we always add a semicolon after similar to C
console.log(x, y);
