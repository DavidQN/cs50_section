If you are interested in running the code in this directory without downloading it locally to you machine I placed them within a workspace so you can run them on the cloud IDE without any hassle.

Both versions are supposed to mirror one another. So if you are more familiar with C (which you should be if you are within my section) then take a look at both the links. Since both versions mimic each other, the code files that share the same name in both the C and Python links, are the ones that mimic each other.
`Example: string.c mimics string.py`
